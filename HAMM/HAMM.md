### Problem

Given two strings _s_ and _t_ of equal length, the Hamming distance between _s_ and _t_, denoted _dH(s,t)_, is the number of corresponding symbols that differ in _s_ and _t_. See Figure 2.

**Given**: Two DNA strings _s_ and _t_ of equal length (not exceeding 1 kbp).

**Return**: The Hamming distance _dH(s,t)_.
