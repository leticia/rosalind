# Rosalind

Rosalind is a platform for learning Bioinformatics through problem solving.

This is an attempt to solve some of the [problems](https://rosalind.info/problems/). Folders and files are named according to ID, each folder having the problem's description and the solution.

I'm using Python, but might try something different later. Maybe Perl, Go or Julia, I don't know. [@erickpintor](https://github.com/erickpintor) is using Zig. He's weird.
