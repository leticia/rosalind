### Problem

In DNA strings, symbols 'A' and 'T' are complements of each other, as are 'C' and 'G'.

The reverse complement of a DNA string _s_ is the string _sc_ formed by reversing the symbols of _s_, then taking the complement of each symbol (e.g., the reverse complement of "GTCA" is "TGAC").

**Given**: A DNA string _s_ of length at most 1000 bp.

**Return**: The reverse complement _sc_ of _s_.
